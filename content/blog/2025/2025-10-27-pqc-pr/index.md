**Kuala Lumpur ‚Äî 27 October 2025** ‚Äî The PKI Consortium announced that the Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Conference will take place from 28 to 30 October 2025, at the Connexion Conference & Event Centre in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, bringing together over 2,500 delegates from government, industry, and academia. This event marks the world‚Äôs largest dedicated global conference on post-quantum cryptography ever held. The three-day program will feature hands-on workshops, high-level plenaries, and technical tracks focused on the standards, implementation strategies, and policy frameworks required to secure digital infrastructure against emerging quantum threats.

## Safeguarding The Digital Future   

Quantum computers will soon have the power to break much of the encryption that protects today‚Äôs digital communications, financial systems, and government data. Transitioning to quantum-safe cryptography is critical to maintaining privacy, trust, and security in a world where quantum capabilities are advancing quickly. The PKI Consortium‚Äôs PQC Conference helps organizations understand the urgency, tools, and global coordination needed to make this transition safely and effectively. ‚ÄúThis week, global leaders are moving the transition to Post-Quantum Cryptography from planning to execution,‚Äù said Paul van Brouwershaven, Chair of the PKI Consortium. ‚ÄúMalaysia is a wonderful place for leaders to meet and provides a strong foundation for regional and international collaboration as we secure the world for the quantum era.‚Äù

## Event Highlights:  

### Day 1: Tuesday, 28 October: Hands-On Workshops &  Industry Roundtables  

Participants will engage in practical implementation sessions, live demonstrations, and collaborative roundtables focused on cryptographic modernization. Key sectors, including telecommunications, finance, healthcare, and government, will share migration frameworks and best practices.  
Full details for these workshops and panels can be found here: [Day 1 Agenda](https://pkic.org/events/2025/pqc-conference-kuala-lumpur-my/#nav-tuesday).

### Day 2 & 3: Wednesday & Thursday, 29-30 October: Malaysia‚Äôs Vision, Regional Leadership, and Global Speakers
  
On 29 October, the conference opens with remarks from the **Secretary General of the Ministry of Digital (Malaysia),** who will outline the nation‚Äôs roadmap for building a quantum-secure ASEAN. This will be followed by a presentation from the **National Cyber Security Agency (NACSA)** detailing Malaysia‚Äôs national PQC readiness plan. Their participation underscores Malaysia‚Äôs leadership in advancing digital trust and secure technology standards across Southeast Asia. More than 70 global experts will deliver high-level talks and technical sessions exploring standards, policy frameworks, and implementation strategies for quantum-safe ecosystems.
