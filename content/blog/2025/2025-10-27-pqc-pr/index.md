**Kuala Lumpur — 27 October 2025** — The PKI Consortium announced that the [Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) Conference](/events/2025/pqc-conference-kuala-lumpur-my/) will take place from 28 to 30 October 2025, at the Connexion Conference & Event Centre in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, bringing together over 2,500 delegates from government, industry, and academia. This event marks the world’s largest dedicated global conference on post-quantum cryptography ever held. The three-day program will feature hands-on workshops, high-level plenaries, and technical tracks focused on the standards, implementation strategies, and policy frameworks required to secure digital infrastructure against emerging quantum threats.

## Safeguarding The Digital Future   

Quantum computers will soon have the power to break much of the encryption that protects today’s digital communications, financial systems, and government data. Transitioning to quantum-safe cryptography is critical to maintaining privacy, trust, and security in a world where quantum capabilities are advancing quickly. The PKI Consortium’s PQC Conference helps organizations understand the urgency, tools, and global coordination needed to make this transition safely and effectively. 

> This week, global leaders are moving the transition to Post-Quantum Cryptography from planning to execution. 
>
> Malaysia is a wonderful place for leaders to meet and provides a strong foundation for regional and international collaboration as we secure the world for the quantum era.
