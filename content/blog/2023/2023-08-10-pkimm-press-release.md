## The model promises comprehensive assessment, benchmarking, and optimization of PKI implementations

**The PKI Consortium, a dynamic alliance dedicated to enhancing trust and security within the digital landscape, proudly announces the preview release of its pioneering PKI Maturity Model. A collaborative effort by the PKI Maturity Model Working Group, this model will revolutionize the way organizations can plan, evaluate, and compare Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) implementations.**

The [PKI Maturity Model](/pkimm/) draws inspiration from the renowned Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) developed by Carnegie Mellon University. It provides organizations with the tools to:
- Gain swift insight into the current capabilities and performance of their PKI
- Facilitate confidential benchmarking against similar entities, based on size or industry
- Receive actionable guidance to enhance PKI capabilities
- Elevate overall PKI performance

The model introduces a comprehensive five-level framework, enabling organizations to gauge their PKI maturity and associated risks. These levels, from Initial to Optimized, reflect evolving capabilities and proactive strategies.

Structured into four Modules and fifteen Categories that encompass aspects of PKI spanning people, processes, and technology, the PKI Maturity Model offers a comprehensive approach to assessment. The overall maturity level is determined by the collective maturity of these categories.

To facilitate the assessment process, the model comes with a user-friendly Excel-based tool that seamlessly navigates assessors through the evaluation journey and automatically generates detailed reports based on provided inputs.
