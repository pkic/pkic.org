The PKI Consortium is proud to announce that **IBM** has become our first **Diamond Sponsor**, marking a significant milestone in the continued growth and global impact of our community.

IBM has been an active member of the PKI Consortium since **January 2024**, contributing to our working groups and supporting Consortium initiatives over the past two years. Becoming our Diamond Sponsor reflects a deepened commitment to the mission of advancing Public Key Infrastructure and accelerating the global transition to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC).

## A Shared Commitment to Security and Trust

As organizations around the world prepare for the post-quantum era, collaboration between technology providers, enterprises, government agencies, and standards bodies has never been more critical.

IBM has long been a leader in cryptography, enterprise security, and quantum research. Their Diamond Sponsorship underscores the importance of industry-wide cooperation to:

- Strengthen global PKI deployments
- Promote crypto-agility and migration readiness
- Advance practical PQC implementation guidance
- Support education, interoperability, and best practices

The PKI Consortium's mission is to provide neutral, vendor-agnostic guidance and foster collaboration across the ecosystem. Diamond Sponsorship plays a vital role in sustaining this mission and enabling us to deliver resources, working groups, research initiatives, and global education programs to the broader community.

## A Message from the Board Chair

> "As we look toward a post-quantum future, partnerships like this are pivotal. IBM's leadership and support will help empower organizations globally to achieve both crypto-agility and resilience in the transition to Post-Quantum Cryptography. Together, we are ensuring a more secure and trusted digital ecosystem."
>
> — **Chris Bailey**, Board Chair, PKI Consortium

## Supporting the World's Largest Dedicated PQC Conference

IBM's Diamond Sponsorship also supports the PKI Consortium's upcoming **5th Annual Post-Quantum Cryptography Conference** — the world's largest dedicated PQC event, bringing together:

- Certificate Authorities
- Cryptographic vendors
- Enterprise security leaders
- Government agencies
- Standards organizations
- Researchers and academic experts

With expanded capacity and deeper implementation-focused sessions, the next conference is expected to build on prior record-breaking attendance and industry participation. Full details — including program highlights, venue information, and registration — will be announced in March.

IBM's support helps ensure that this event, and the broader PKIC initiatives, continue to provide high-quality, globally accessible education and collaboration opportunities.

## Advancing the Global Transition to PQC

The transition to PQC is not theoretical — it is operational. Organizations are actively planning, testing, and deploying quantum-safe strategies today.

Through its Diamond Sponsorship, IBM is helping the PKI Consortium:

- Expand technical working groups
- Strengthen maturity models for PKI and PQC
- Increase global outreach and education
- Provide practical guidance for real-world implementation

On behalf of the PKI Consortium Board of Directors and our global membership, we extend our sincere thanks to IBM for their continued membership and generous partnership.

Together, we will continue advancing trust, security, crypto-agility, and cryptographic resilience worldwide.
