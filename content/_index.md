## PKI Consortium

The PKI Consortium is comprised of leading organizations that are committed to improve, create and collaborate on generic, industry or use-case specific policies, procedures, best practices, standards and tools that advance trust in assets and communication for everyone and everything using Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) as well as the security of the internet in general. By engaging with users, regulators, supervisory bodies and other interested or relying parties the consortium can address actual issues. [learn more...](/about/)
    
## Public Key Infrastructure

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) defines the foundation for most modern security systems and provides **Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, **Authenticity** and **Non-repudiation**. It relies on public key cryptography, a universally accepted asymmetric technology that enables entities to securely communicate using an insecure transport or media, reliably link the data to the signatory and protects the integrity of the data while proving guarantees about the existence of the data at the time of signature creation.
