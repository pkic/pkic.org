NgKore is Indiaâ€™s first open-source community dedicated to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) and eBPF. We bring together researchers, engineers, and innovators to explore and advance next-generation technologies such as Quantum-Safe Networks, 6G, O-RAN, Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN), AI/ML integration, blockchain, quantum technologies, and cloud-native architectures.

Driven by a shared vision of open innovation, we design scalable, secure, and future-ready solutions that empower global technological progress. Our focus on openness and interoperability replaces proprietary hardware and closed systems with open-source software, giving vendors, operators, and developers the freedom to innovate without lock-in.

We actively publish end-to-end deployment guides, technical insights, and demonstration videos to help others build and scale open telecom systems. Entirely self-funded and bootstrapped, NgKore thrives through collaborations with academic institutions and industry partners who provide access to advanced testing infrastructure and resources.
