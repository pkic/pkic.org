### History: Information about founding and contributions to the PKI Consortium. 

Our passion is entrenched in the desire to educate our clients and prospects on best practices, emerging trends and sharing our thought leadership.  We have been deeply involved in standard setting since SAS70 was created in 1992.  Providing thought leadership for new services to address emerging needs of our industry is something we take great pride in; we don’t merely join organizations, we get involved and contribute.  As SAS70 was morphing into SOC1, and the creation of SOC2 was taking place, we were involved in their development.  We were also involved with the creation of WebTrust for Certification Authorities since its inception.  We are familiar with many of the PKI Consortium members already through our active participation in these other venues.
