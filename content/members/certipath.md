## Providing solutions for the use, validation, and integration of high-assurance identities

The next wave of systems security measures will evolve from better knowledge of the people and resources that organizations allow to access their assets. User identity and systems identity are the keys to trusted access. For more than a decade, CertiPath has been designing, implementing, and supporting systems and solutions that analyze and validate identity credential usage for security-conscious clients. CertiPathâ€™s TrustSuite of identity security products are designed to address gaps left by network security solutions and expose threats posed by intruders intent on bypassing traditional security infrastructure under the guise of trusted identities.

## Groundbreaking PKI experience

CertiPath extends to commercial entities the same trust fabric relied upon by the U.S. federal government. The CertiPath Bridge community is a fully functioning, independent trust community that partners with the U.S. Federal PKI to provide uninterrupted cross-community trust and interoperability. The CertiPath Bridge was modeled on the Federal Bridge concept first espoused by NIST in response to the U.S. Federal CIO challenge to establish PKI as a ubiquitous, interoperable capability across the Federal enterprise. In 2006, the CertiPath Bridge became the first commercial bridge to cross-certify with the U.S. Federal PKI Bridge. We were driven in our collaboration with Federal PKI by the need for our member community to have seamless interoperability with various departments in the U.S. federal government. As a result, we helped Federal PKI prove the viability of the Bridge-to-Bridge concept. The value of this collaboration continues today as both communities become ever more dependent on the capabilities of PKI for providing identity assurance, signature, and confidentiality for digital communications.
