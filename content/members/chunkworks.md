## Chunk Works: Enabling secure and future-ready data infrastructure
Chunk Works develops software that enhances the security and resilience of any private/public cloud and on-premises infrastructures by transforming them into post-quantum-ready decentralized networks. Our solution prepares organizations to protect their data against evolving threats while ensuring they maintain full control and ownership.

One of the biggest challenges in data security today is the transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Many existing encryption methods will become vulnerable as quantum computing advances, making it necessary for organizations to update their security strategies. However, migrating to PQC can be complex, costly, and time-consuming. Our technology simplifies this process, allowing businesses to implement post-quantum security faster, with lower costs, and minimal operational disruption.

Beyond encryption, our solution chunks data which can be automatically distributed across multiple locations, rather than being stored in a single place. This means that even if part of an infrastructure is compromised, the data remains protected. Since all data is encrypted before being stored or transmitted, only the rightful owner retains the ability to access and manage it. This guarantees that organizations have full ownership and control, reducing the risk of unauthorized access, data breaches, or vendor lock-in.

By implementing our technology, businesses can secure their data infrastructure for the long term while ensuring compliance with regulations like NIST. Additionally, as a PKI Consortium member, Chunk Works contributes to the development of security standards that help organizations protect their digital assets and prepare for future challenges.
