## Quantum is Now

Terra Quantum is a leading quantum technology company based in Germany and Switzerland, offering quantum solutions engineered for real-world impact. We empower industry and government partners with three core offerings:
- **Quantum Software as a Service**: Our robust software suite spans quantum AI, hybrid-quantum optimization, physics-driven AI for computational chemistry, and moreâ€”all delivered through TQ42, our enterprise-grade quantum ecosystem. This platform makes advanced quantum tools easily accessible and deployable, enabling customers to solve complex, high-value problems.
- **Quantum Computing as a Service**: We provide immediate access to high-performance simulated quantum processing units (QPUs) as well as physical QPUs from the quantum ecosystem, while continuously advancing new qubit technology.
- **Quantum Security as a Service**: Our security solutions leverage state-of-the-art post-quantum cryptographic systems and quantum key distribution protocols to safeguard data in motion and at rest. Offerings such as the Terra Quantum Secure Network and our NIST-validated cryptographic libraries are designed for scalability and seamless integration with existing networks, delivering a resilient defense against cyber threats while meeting rigorous international standards.

At Terra Quantum, our mission is to bridge the gap between breakthrough quantum research and practical, market-ready solutions. We focus on making our technology easily deployable through interoperable tools, so organizations can rapidly integrate quantum advancements into their security, computing, and business performance strategies.
