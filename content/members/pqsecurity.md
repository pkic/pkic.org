## About PQSecure

PQSecure Technologies is a leading provider of post-quantum cryptographic (PQC) solutions for securing embedded systems, IoT devices, and high-assurance applications. Specializing in hardware and software cryptographic IPs, PQSecure develops efficient and secure implementations of NIST-recommended PQC algorithms with built-in side-channel and fault attack protections. Our solutions undergo formal verification to ensure cryptographic correctness, resilience against attacks, and compliance with industry standards. This enables a seamless transition to quantum-safe security, ensuring long-term protection for digital identities, authentication mechanisms, and secure communications.

As a member of the PKI Consortium, PQSecure is committed to advancing post-quantum public key infrastructure (PKI) by contributing expertise in secure implementations, formal verification, and best practices for adopting quantum-resistant cryptographic protocols.
