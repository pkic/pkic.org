## About Keysight
Keysight is a leader in side-channel analysis (SCA) and fault injection (FI). Building on more than 20 years of device security expertise pioneered by Riscure, Keysight solutions and services help developers protect their products from both physical and logical vulnerabilities. With proven methods and advanced solutions, Keysightâ€™s research lab strengthens security across industries, ensuring robust defenses for next-generation semiconductors, embedded systems, and devices.
 
Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) readiness and assurance:
We help organizations plan, implement, and validate PQC from concept through certification. Our teams harden implementations against SCA and FI and assess performance and footprint on embedded devices and hardware accelerators. Our solutions and services support pre-silicon analysis and emulation, post-silicon validation, and the creation of assurance evidence for standards-based evaluations (such as Common Criteria and FIPS 140-3). We also test end-to-end security workflows (device identity, secure boot, attestation, and update mechanisms) to ensure crypto-agile deployments that maintain security, performance, and compliance over time.
