## The Bridge to Digitalization in Financial Industries

We operate in a highly regulated and therefore rather rigid environment in which automation is progressing slowly. The new DORA regulation that has recently come into force is particularly challenging in this regard. Supporting our customers in complying with these regulations is a unique opportunity for us, which we are pursuing through the use of modern technologies such as EDR and AI. With the help of strong technology partners, we are able to meet all requirements and focus on our own core competencies. FI-TS continues to meet new regulatory requirements and the growing threat of cyberattacks in highly available, resilient data centers, where both legacy IT operations such as mainframes and, above all, digital transformation in the hybrid cloud based on the three-pillar strategy of the FI-TS Finance Cloud are offered in a particularly collaborative partnership.
