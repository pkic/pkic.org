## 5. Directors, Board of Directors

PKIC shall maintain a Board of Directors of at least three Directors. Each Member of the PKI Consortium may (but is not required to) appoint one Director to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may approve amendments to the Articles of Incorporation and take such other actions as the Articles of Incorporation provide.

## 6. Officers

The officers of PKIC shall be a Chair and a Vice Chair (who will act as Chair when the Chair is absent).  Each officer will be elected for a 12-month term, and may be elected to successive terms. Prior to election, the Member representatives will be asked who is interested in being elected to the positions. If there is only one candidate for an officer position, the election will occur by consensus. Otherwise, the election will be held by vote (one vote per member). If there are only two candidates, then the candidate with the most votes wins. If there are more than two candidates, then there will be successive votes (with the candidate with the fewest votes eliminated each time) until an officer is elected by a more than 50% of the votes. 

## 7. Voting

Except as otherwise required by these Bylaws, PKIC will attempt to reach all decisions by consensus (as determined by the Chair) of all members. In the event that consensus cannot be reached (or upon the request of any voting member), PKIC will submit the matter for a vote. Unless otherwise required by these Bylaws, the matter will be decided by majority vote of members who cast a vote. In the case of a tie vote, the matter will not be approved.

## 8. Antitrust Policy: From time to time at PKIC meetings, the following antitrust policy statement will be read allowed to Members. All Members agree to follow this policy at all times.

This meeting is intended to discuss activities relating to the Purposes of the Public Key Infrastructure Consortium without restricting competition in developing and marketing such products and/or services.
