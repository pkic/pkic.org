### Process for Admitting New Members

In order to admit new members, all membership applications must agree to follow these Bylaws and the PKI Consortium Code of Conduct located at https://pkic.org/code-of-conduct.  Applications must be approved by an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of then-existing PKIC members. Voting on a membership application by each member shall be based solely on a determination by the member of whether or not the applicant meets the stated membership criteria, and not on any other basis including competitive considerations.

### Maintaining Membership status

Members may withdraw at any time upon providing written or email notice to other Members. A Member who fails to meet the membership criteria stated, or fails to adhere to the Code of Conduct or Antitrust Policy, will impose consequences such as a warning, reprimanding, suspension or the member can lose its membership status following a written or email proposal by at least three Members to withdraw membership status from the Member and approval of the proposal by an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Members (not including the Member who is the subject of the proposal to withdraw membership, who is not entitled to vote on the proposal). 

Changes in Membership Criteria: The membership eligibility criteria may be changed from time to time upon an affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Members.

## 5. Directors, Board of Directors

PKIC shall maintain a Board of Directors of at least three Directors. Each Member of the PKI Consortium may (but is not required to) appoint one Director to the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors may approve amendments to the Articles of Incorporation and take such other actions as the Articles of Incorporation provide.

## 6. Officers

The officers of PKIC shall be a Chair and a Vice Chair (who will act as Chair when the Chair is absent).  Each officer will be elected for a 12-month term, and may be elected to successive terms. Prior to election, the Member representatives will be asked who is interested in being elected to the positions. If there is only one candidate for an officer position, the election will occur by consensus. Otherwise, the election will be held by vote (one vote per member). If there are only two candidates, then the candidate with the most votes wins. If there are more than two candidates, then there will be successive votes (with the candidate with the fewest votes eliminated each time) until an officer is elected by a more than 50% of the votes. 

## 7. Voting

Except as otherwise required by these Bylaws, PKIC will attempt to reach all decisions by consensus (as determined by the Chair) across all members and eligibility member categories. In the event that consensus cannot be reached (or upon the request of any voting member), PKIC will submit the matter for a vote. Unless otherwise required by these Bylaws, the matter will be decided by majority vote of the eligibility member categories who cast a vote. The vote of the eligibility member category will be decided by majority vote of members who cast a vote in that category. In the case of a tie vote, the matter will not be approved.

## 8. Antitrust Policy
From time to time at PKIC meetings, the following antitrust policy statement will be read allowed to Members. All Members agree to follow this policy at all times.

“As you know, this meeting includes companies that compete against one another. This meeting is intended to discuss activities relating to the Purposes of the Public Key Infrastructure Consortium without restricting competition in developing and marketing such products and/or services. This meeting is not intended to share competitively-sensitive information among competitors, and therefore all participants agree not to discuss or exchange information related to:

- **(b)** Costs, cost structures, profit margins,
- **(c)** Pending or planned service offerings,
- **(d)** Customers, business, or marketing plans; or
- **(e)** The allocation of customers, territories, or products in any way.”
