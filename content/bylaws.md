## 4. Sponsors and Donations

To support the activities of the PKI Consortium we accept sponsors and donations. Sponsors will be listed on the PKIC website and may receive benefits as described in the sponsorship brochure, but do not gain any other special treatment or rights. Sponsors and donations may support the development of specific projects but will never be permitted to influence the outcome of a policy.

Information about sponsorship levels, donation options, and related benefits will be published at http://pkic.org/sponsors and revised and updated on a regular basis.

PKIC may establish a bank account or may deposit funds with a third-party company (e.g., a support company providing services to PKIC) to hold without interest and apply to invoices approved by the Chair or the Vice-Chair and the Executive Council on PKIC’s behalf.

## 5. Board of Directors

PKIC shall maintain a Board of Directors with an odd number of at least three (3) Directors but not more than seven (7). Directors will be elected for a two (2) year term commencing on July 1 and may be reelected. The Board of Directors may elect its own officers and approve amendments to the Articles of Incorporation and take such other actions as the Articles of Incorporation provide.

When the term of a Director expires, the Board of Directors may nominate a new Director (or re-nominate the existing Director for a new term), and the nomination will be subject to approval by the voting Members.

The Board of Directors shall meet at least annually to discuss PKIC activities and future plans.

## 6. Officers

The officers of PKIC shall be a Chair and a Vice Chair (who will act as Chair when the Chair is absent). Each officer will be elected for a two (2) year term commencing on July 1 and may be elected to successive terms. Prior to election, the voting Member representatives will be asked who is interested in being elected to the positions. If there is only one candidate for an officer position, the election will occur by consensus. Otherwise, the election will be held by vote (one vote per Member). If there are only two candidates, then the candidate with the most votes wins. If there are more than two candidates, then there will be successive ballots (with the candidate with the fewest votes eliminated each time) until an officer is elected by at least 50% of the votes plus one vote.

## 7. Executive Council

The Board of Directors shall nominate an Executive Council with an odd number of up to fifteen (15) Member representatives from those voting Members who have been most active on PKIC projects, giving priority to those Member representatives who are active on PKIC activities and meetings.

Executive Council nominations are subject to approval by the Members. The Executive Council may elect a chair to conduct its meetings. Member representatives may not serve on the Executive Council after they are no longer associated with the Member.

## 8. Indemnification

PKIC will indemnify its directors, officers, employees, fiduciaries, and agents to the maximum extent permitted under Utah Code Annotated Sec. 16-6a-902, 16-6a-903, and 16-6a-907 from the corporation’s resources.

## 9. Working Groups

For relevancy and efficiency, the PKI Consortium may select topics for Member-specific Working Groups. Eligibility to join a Working Group can be restricted to certain types of Members. Working Groups define if their mailing list(s) and/or meetings are public (i.e., publicly available on the Internet), restricted (i.e., available to Members of the Working Group and others who are invited to participate) or private (i.e., limited to the Members of the Working Group).

Working Groups may be created in two ways:

- **(a)** After consultation with the Members of PKIC, the Chair may create a new Working Group and establish its goals, objectives, and any limitations (e.g., as to who may participate, what materials will be made public, etc.).  Working group members may choose their own Chair and Vice Chair.  After consultation with the Members of PKIC, the PKIC Chair may dissolve the Working Group if its work is complete or cannot be completed.
- **(b)** Any ten (10) Members may propose the creation of a new Working Group and establish its goals, objectives, and any limitations (e.g., as to who may participate, what materials will be made public, etc.).  Approval of the proposal shall be by substantial consensus of the Members of PKIC and by the Executive Council Committee.  Working group members may choose their own Chair and Vice Chair.  After consultation with the Members of PKIC, the PKIC Chair may dissolve the Working Group if its work is complete or cannot be completed.

All decisions in a Working Group shall be made by substantial consensus as determined by the Working Group Chair.  If substantial consensus cannot be reached (or upon the request of any three Working Group Members), the matter will be submitted for decision by the Executive Council. 

## 10. Voting

Except as otherwise required by these Bylaws, PKIC will attempt to reach all decisions by substantial consensus (as determined by the Chair) of all Members including interested parties. In the event that substantial consensus cannot be reached (or upon the request of any three Members), PKIC will submit the matter for a vote to the Executive Council (except as to approval of officers and members of the Executive Council, who must be approved by vote of the Members). Unless otherwise required by these Bylaws, the matter will be decided by majority vote of the members of the Executive Council who cast a vote. In the case of a tie vote, the matter will not be approved.

## 11. Antitrust Policy

From time to time, members will be informed on the following antitrust policy. All Members agree to follow this policy at all times.

“As you know, this consortium includes companies that compete against one another. This consortium is intended to discuss activities relating to the Purposes of the Public Key Infrastructure Consortium without restricting competition in developing and marketing such products and/or services. This consortium is not intended to share competitively-sensitive information among competitors, and therefore all participants agree not to discuss or exchange information related to:

- **(a)** Pricing policies, pricing formulas, prices or other terms of sale;
- **(b)** Costs, cost structures, profit margins,
- **(c)** Pending or planned service offerings,
- **(d)** Customers, business, or marketing plans; or
- **(e)** The allocation of customers, territories, or products in any way.”
