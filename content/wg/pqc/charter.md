---

This Working Group Charter has been created according to the [“Working Groups”](/bylaws/#9-working-groups) section of the Bylaws of the PKI Consortium (“PKIC”). In the event of a conflict between this Charter and any provision in either the Bylaws or the IPR Policy, the provision in the [Bylaws](/bylaws/) or [IPR Policy](/ipr/) shall take precedence.

## Introduction

This working group brings together individuals and organizations who are passionate about Post-Quantum Cryptography. The working group will collaborate and coordinate activities, share information, and promote knowledge of this rapidly developing field with the working group and the wider community.

## Scope

The scope of this working group is to provide an open platform for members to discuss and share information on Post-Quantum Cryptography, including implications, migration strategies, and other related topics.

This working group will not develop or evaluate cryptographic algorithms or their implementations.

## Objectives and goals

By working collectively, we aim to coordinate various activities, exchange valuable insights, and promote the sharing of essential information related to Post-Quantum Cryptography, benefiting not only our members but also the wider community.

The working group will facilitate information exchange among its members, encouraging discussions and sharing insights on various aspects of Post-Quantum Cryptography. This will include discussions on the implications and development of quantum computing, best practices for implementing PQC, and strategies for transitioning from classical to post-quantum cryptographic algorithms.

## Summary of the planned activities

To achieve the objective and goals of the Post-Quantum Cryptography, the Working Group will gather feedback from its Members, participants and interested parties regarding the structure of the Post-Quantum Cryptography leading to development of a robust and recognized model and assessment methodology.

Within the activities carried out by the Members of this Working Group are:
- Regular meetings and discussions on the development of the maturity model and related changes
- Collecting information and feedback from interested parties regarding the maturity model and assessment process
- Contributing to the definition of the overall maturity model, including its categories, maturity levels, and assessment process
- Collaborating on the assessment methodology for maturity model
- Creating awareness about the Post-Quantum Cryptography, assessment methodology, its adoption and how to use it

Change in activities described in this Working Group Charter must follow the “Decision process” described in this document.

## Summary of the deliverables

[PQC Capabilities Matrix (PQCCM)](https://pkic.org/pqccm/): The working group will manage a PQCCM, which will serve as a comprehensive repository of software applications, libraries, and hardware that offer support for Post-Quantum Cryptography. This matrix will help members and the wider community to identify available PQC solutions without endorsing or evaluating their implementation or quality.

[PQC Conference](https://pkic.org/events/2023/pqc-conference-amsterdam-nl/): From time to time the working group might organize a PKI Consortium Post-Quantum Cryptography Conference where the wider community can come together to present their research, share insights, and discuss the latest advancements in the field of Post-Quantum Cryptography.

## Means of communication

A private mailing list is used for communication between Working Group Members.

Interested parties can contribute using the [community discussions](https://github.com/pkic/community/discussions) on GitHub and Working Group Members will actively participate in those discussions. 

Planning and action items are managed as issues within the same repository as where the deliverables are published.

## Membership and participation

Organizations that are eligible to join this Working Group follow the membership process as described in the [Bylaws](https://pkic.org/bylaws) of the PKIC, section “Membership”.

In accordance with the IPR policy, Members that choose to participate in this Working Group must declare their participation prior to participating by contacting the Chair of this Working Group.

The Chair of this Working Group must establish a list for declarations of participation and manage it in accordance with the PKIC Bylaws and the IPR policy and agreement.

Non-members can participate using the [community discussions](https://github.com/pkic/community/discussions).

## Decision process

The decision process follows [Bylaws](https://pkic.org/bylaws) of the PKIC, with reference to sections “Voting” and “Working Group”.

All decisions in this Working Group shall be made by substantial consensus (as determined by the Working Group Chair) of all PKIC Members including interested parties. If substantial consensus cannot be reached (or upon the request of any three PKIC Members), the matter will be submitted for decision by the Executive Council.

## IPR policy

This Working Group is subject to the [Intellectual Property Rights Agreement](https://pkic.org/ipr), [Code of Conduct](https://pkic.org/code-of-conduc) and [Bylaws](https://pkic.org/bylaws) of the PKIC, including the Antitrust Policy.

## Antitrust policy

In accordance with the PKIC antitrust policy, as stated by the PKIC Bylaws, an antitrust statement should be applied and read at the start of all Working Group meetings, in substantially the form written in PKIC Bylaws, chapter “Antitrust Policy”.

## Other applicable policies

Any relevant PKIC policies defined by the Bylaws must be followed if not specifically excluded by this Working Group Charter.
