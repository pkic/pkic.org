intro: |
  The **PKI Maturity Model (PKIMM)** Working Group develops and maintains a globally recognized framework for evaluating, planning, and improving PKI implementations.
  Organizations worldwide use the model to benchmark their current posture, identify gaps, and chart a structured path toward operational excellence.

  The model is intended for all entities that operate public key infrastructure, regardless of size, industry, or use-case. Adoption is voluntary — it does not impose mandatory requirements.

  Our goal is to build a PKI maturity model recognized around the globe as a standard for evaluation, planning, and comparison between different PKI implementations, serving as a basis for assessment services and action plans for PKI environments.
