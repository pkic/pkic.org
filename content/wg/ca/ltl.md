The List of Trust Lists (LTL) is a centralized, vendor-neutral directory of digital trust repositories maintained by public, private, and industry-specific operators worldwide. Rather than acting as a standalone certificate store, the LTL functions as an authoritative index of trust frameworks, each defining its own trust anchors, policies, and governance models. By offering a unified, machine-readable point of discovery for these distributed trust lists, the LTL improves transparency and interoperability across ecosystems, enabling organizations to identify, assess, and integrate the trust frameworks required to validate digital signatures and secure communications in a consistent and policy-aware manner.
