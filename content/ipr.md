I recognize that my participation in PKIC activities and projects may involve the contribution of intellectual property that may be incorporated into the PKIC activities, projects, standards, products, or services, including copyrights, patents, and other intellectual property belonging to my Organization (if applicable) or to me (together, “ Intellectual Property”).

I wish to make such contributions of Intellectual Property on behalf of my Organization (if applicable) and myself, and all such Intellectual Property is contributed together with a world-wide, perpetual, non-exclusive license (“License”) to use the Intellectual Property by PKIC, its Members, and the public worldwide in connection with such PKIC activities, projects, standards, products, or services.  I warrant that I have the authority to make this IPRA and grant of License on behalf of my Organization (if applicable).

I agree not to disclose or contribute any intellectual property owned or claimed by my Organization (if applicable) or by me during my participation in PKIC activities and projects unless the disclosure or contribution is intended to be contributed with the License as described in the previous paragraph.

If any PKIC activities, projects, standards, products, or services includes any Intellectual Property contributed by my organization (if applicable) or by me and my organization (if applicable) or I do not want to grant the License described above, I understand that it is my organization’s (if applicable) and my obligation to immediately notify the Chair of that fact or else the License will be granted.

From time to time (e.g., on major PKIC activities, projects, standards, products, or services that involve enforceable or auditable standards), the Chair may give notice (“Notice”) before the publication or contextual change becomes effective. The Notice will call for a statement from each Member and Member representative of any Intellectual Property for which the Member or Member Representative does not want to contribute the License described above.

I accept that each time such Notice is given my Organization (if applicable) and I have thirty (30) days to disclose any Intellectual Property contained in such PKIC activities, projects, standards, products, or services that involve enforceable or auditable standards for which my Organization (if applicable) or I do not want to contribute a License as described above.  I further accept that failing to do so will result in the grant of the License as described above.
