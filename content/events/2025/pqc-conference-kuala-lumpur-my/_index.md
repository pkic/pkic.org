          - title: Securing the future Internet of Things with ML-KEM and ML-DSA
            description: |
              Today's Internet of Things (IoT) relies on a variety of protocols and communications technologies…CoAP, LwM2M, LoRaWAN, NB-IoT, Wi-Fi, Thread … many of which are not quantum-safe. 
              
              While large-scale quantum computers capable of breaking current encryption aren't yet available, the concept of ""harvest now, decrypt later"" is a significant concern. Now that NIST has released final versions of its first three Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standards the race is on to make IoT quantum-safe.
              
              **We will explore:**

          - title: Create your own quantum-safe signed PDF documents with hybrid cryptography
            description: |
              This workshop is from a collaborative effort between TNO and Zynyo. Standards are now established and libraries are being released, the integration of Post-Quantum Cryptography into products is increasing. However, the adoption of PQC is not yet universal across all scenarios and use-cases. This workshop provides a unique opportunity for participants to create signed PDF documents with hybrid PQC. DSS is a software supported by the European commission, whose functionality is the creation of digital signatures based on ETSI standards in line with European legislation such as the eIDAS regulation. TNO and Zynyo adapted DSS to support different types of hybrid certification to increase quantum-readiness.

              **In this workshop we will:**

              * Explore three different types of hybrid certificates (Catalyst, Composite, Chameleon),
              * Have an interactive workshop on the construction and validation of hybrid certificates,
              * Sign PDF documents using different types of hybrid certificates,
              * Validate signatures to confirm their authenticity and integrity,
              * Visualize signed PDFs and have tangible proof of their validity.

            description: |
              The transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) is not a challenge faced by a single industry—it is a global transformation impacting every sector. In this 30-minute kickoff, we bring together key insights gathered from focused workshops across energy, government, financial services, and healthcare. Each vertical faces unique obstacles—regulatory demands, legacy systems, critical infrastructure dependencies, and high-stakes data protection—yet all share the urgent need for agility and trust in a quantum-ready world. This session distills the highlights from these discussions into a unified perspective: where the sectors stand today, the common themes emerging across industries, and the roadmap ahead. Attendees will walk away with a clear understanding of how PQC adoption is taking shape across the economy and what steps are necessary to drive coordinated, cross-sector progress.

            description: |
              The cryptographic community is actively debating the shift to Post-Quantum PKI as quantum computing progresses and NIST advances standardization. While larger certificate sizes (15–22KB extra) raise concerns about WebPKI performance, the transition is essential. Amazon Private CA, used by thousands, is positioned to support this shift.
              
              We’ll present performance data on MLWE-based TLS, analyzing Core Web Vitals and how larger certs affect connection latency and user experience across HTML, JS, and image delivery. We'll cover both parallel and sequential connection patterns. Our mTLS benchmarks span TLS 1.2 vs. 1.3, cipher negotiations (classical vs PQ), and cert sizes from RSA/ECDSA to ML-DSA. Results include handshake-only (TTFB) and full load (TTLB) metrics across scenarios.

            description: |
              Cryptographic agility is often misunderstood as purely a technical problem. This presentation challenges that assumption, arguing that agility requirements are context-dependent, often organizational in nature, and ultimately a subset of broader organizational agility.

              We begin by classifying different types of PKI agility according to the need for being agile. This includes replacing the underlying cryptographic algorithms and why size matters,  re-issuing certificates, replacing certificates hierarchies, reacting to key compromise and migrating to quantum safety. Through concrete examples, we show how lack of agility impacts dimensions differently. Some of the lessons date back 20 years to the transition from RSA to ECC and the experience gained deploying hybrid systems in sensitive government projects. Other lessons are more recent, for example the hybrid secure-boot mechanism on the IBM mainframe.

          - title: A Framework for Cryptographic Agility
            description: |
              Cryptography is no longer a "set it and forget it" component of software architecture. With the rapid emergence of post-quantum cryptographic standards and the constant discovery of new vulnerabilities, organizations face a growing need to adapt quickly without rewriting applications every time the cryptographic landscape shifts.
              
              This talk will focus on the practical aspects of designing cryptographic systems that enable organizations to transition to post-quantum cryptography in a crypto-agile manner. By embedding agility into the way cryptography is consumed through abstraction, policy, key lifecycle management, and pluggable backends, organizations can avoid costly re-architecture each time cryptographic standards evolve. The framework is modular and composable, allowing teams to adopt incremental levels of cryptographic agility. This allows organizations to evolve toward a truly agile posture at a pace aligned with their security, performance, and compliance needs.

            description: |
              As enterprises prepare for post-quantum cryptography (PQC), the ability to discover, manage, and transition cryptographic assets at scale has become a mission-critical capability. Certificate Lifecycle Management (CLM) is often seen as the answer, but CLM at enterprise scale is more complex than most anticipate. This panel brings together thought leaders from various CLM vendors and industry experts to unpack the strategic lessons learned and operational friction points that organizations face in aligning CLM systems with quantum-resilient architectures.

            description: |
              Stateful hash based signatures provide the best ratio of maturity and efficiency but require the handling of the state in a secure manner.
              In this talk we show how to leverage the usability and practical efficiency of stateful signature schemes.
              
              We show how to (nearly) close the gap between stateful and stateless signature schemes by a high level of automation built on top of a secure distributed state handling scheme.

              Furthermore, we show details and lessons learned of how to increase the efficiency by distributing the key generation process and outsourcing the computation of the public authentication path to trustworthy external modules.
              
              Putting all the pieces together results in a highly agile architecture that provides the maximum of flexibility for the whole life span of the use case by fully preserving the security and maturity of the stateful hash based signatures.

            description: |
              As the risk increases for a ‘cryptographically relevant quantum computer’ to appear, the high level of complexity, required time, and the required cost of a migration to adopt quantum-safe cryptography become apparent. Priorities for the quantum-safe migration need to become therefore clear and an organization-wide migration program needs to be set-up. This presentation will describe an approach to migrating to quantum-safe cryptography, drawing on real customer examples from different industries. It will explore the challenges of each stage and discuss some concrete steps taken in both strategic and technical dimensions. This presentation will describe a phased approach, starting with establishing awareness and understanding of the quantum-impact on an organization, as well as the establishment of a structured model for an efficient transformation. It will also focus on where cryptographic monitoring and cryptographic agility elements fit into this journey.

              The migration to quantum safe algorithms have started. Many of the pieces needed to migrate are now there and can be used in practice, but there are still gaps so an organization's full use of PKI is not yet possible to migrate. The depth and width of this algorithmic migration is so vast that it will be continuous work for years to come filling in gaps as we go. This presentation will take a look at a number of practical use cases that has been tested and proven to work, as well as use cases where it is currently not possible to migrate. Standards, software, hardware and other components will be judged depending on their readiness or not, and of course some performance tests. Are you ready to get your hands dirty?

          - title: HSM Advances Supporting quantum-safe PKI Automation
            description: |
              New advances in Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) are enabling automation opportunities during certificate issuance. One such advance is the progress on hardware-supported attestation where a CA can ascertain the location and disposition associated with the subject key. This supports enforcing policies such as the ones relating to code signing where subject keys must be generated and held by specialized hardware. The concepts surrounding attestation have been developing quickly within the IETF (RATS working group) and work is underway to bridge the gap to HSMs. Attestation functions within the HSM enable other features such as secure audit, verification of the state of an HSM, origin of keys, and more. It is imperative that this attestation capability be quantum-safe if it is to be relied upon for key management of other quantum-safe assets. Furthermore, as attestation relies on hardware roots of trust, this capability must either be deployed at manufacturing time or with the use of quantum-safe mechanisms. This presentation describes a quantum-safe attestation feature, how it can be employed within a PKI environment, and how it can be securely deployed. It also shows the advances in automation and the improvement in compliance that arises from adopting these techniques.

            description: |
              With the release of NIST’s first set of post-quantum cryptographic standards, the conversation around quantum readiness has moved from research into execution. For organizations relying on hardware-based trust anchors, this shift raises immediate strategic and operational questions: What do these new standards mean for existing HSM deployments? How do performance, certification, and lifecycle planning change in a post-quantum world?

              This panel brings together senior leaders from major HSM vendors and PQC experts to provide a clear, business-relevant update on the state of post-quantum integration in hardware cryptographic modules. Building on insights from previous sessions in Austin and Amsterdam, the panel will outline how vendors are approaching the integration of PQC algorithms, what early performance benchmarks indicate, and where the roadblocks lie in certification, customer adoption, and operational interoperability.

              Attendees will gain a practical understanding of the timelines, trade-offs, and architectural considerations shaping the next generation of secure hardware, across both on-premises and cloud HSM landscapes. The discussion will also address how to prepare governance and procurement processes to accommodate cryptographic agility and ensure continuity of trust in regulated and high-assurance environments. 

              This session is essential for CISOs, CTOs, compliance leaders, and architects looking to align their cryptographic infrastructure with emerging quantum-safe mandates, without compromising on performance, reliability, or compliance.

              Most enterprises are preparing for tighter regulations, certificate renewal challenges, and post-quantum threats — yet few have a complete picture of their cryptographic landscape. Without visibility, automation and resilience remain out of reach.

              This session will reveal how organizations can build a robust cryptographic inventory and discovery process, comparing three leading approaches: targeted scanning of cryptographic material, leveraging existing databases, and full enterprise assessments. We’ll map these strategies to US-NIST and CISA use cases, explore their advantages and limitations, and show how they form the foundation for PKI automation and post-quantum readiness.

              Attendees will leave with actionable steps to uncover, document, and manage cryptographic assets, tackle the 47‑day certificate renewal challenge, and build a scalable, future-ready security posture.

              As post-quantum cryptography advances toward deployment, formal verification becomes essential for ensuring trust in both hardware and software implementations. Each PQC algorithm—such as ML-KEM, ML-DSA, and SLH-DSA—presents unique challenges, and while tools like Cryptol, SAW, and Coq offer valuable support, no single framework offers a complete solution. In this talk, we introduce an effort focused on practical formal assurance for PQC. We will demonstrate how Cryptol and SAW can verify key properties of ML-KEM and ML-DSA components. We also highlight the growing role of Rust in cryptographic implementations and discuss the importance of verifying PQC libraries in memory-safe languages. Our goal is to promote scalable, implementation-aware formal methods to ensure secure and verifiable PQC adoption.

            description: |
              Europe is advancing in EV adoption to combat climate change and support renewable energy. This shift requires redesigning the energy infrastructure for charging demands. The DITM project aims to create a digital infrastructure for automated transport, enhancing safety, efficiency, and sustainability. The EnergyPod, part of DITM, optimizes EV charging and manages grid interaction. To secure against future quantum threats, TNO, NXP, and Infiniot upgraded OCPP with hybrid quantum-safe cryptography (TLS handshake and X.509 certificates). This protocol was tested on the NXP “i.MX 8” board, similar to those in real charging stations, and will be used in the EnergyPod. Various migration scenarios were tested, and a dashboard was developed to monitor real-time quantum-safe communication. In this talk, I will discuss the setup, process, challenges, and key takeaways from migrating a high-level protocol to hybrid PQC.

Many have taken that advice to heart, amassing vast amounts of cryptographic data. Now, organizations face the critical question: how do we turn this information into action? 
              This presentation explores that very question. We’ll examine the next critical steps in the PQC transition from multiple perspectives—technical, strategic, and operational—and offer actionable guidance including prioritizing frameworks, risk-based approaches, and implementation timelines to help organizations turn insight into meaningful progress.

            description: |
              We present the strategic vision and technical foundations of Singapore’s National Quantum-Safe Network (NQSN)—a resilient, fully interoperable quantum-safe testbed. Built on production-grade fiber infrastructure in a star-topology layout, the network supports multi-protocol quantum key distribution (QKD) from multiple vendors. A centralized key and network management system ensures interoperability and enables seamless integration across heterogeneous quantum and classical technologies. The testbed also supports diverse reference applications, including data center interconnects, edge computing, hybrid QKD–post-quantum cryptography (PQC) encryption, and multi-layer security across the OSI stack. These efforts demonstrate the feasibility, adaptability, and real-world relevance of deploying quantum-safe technologies in complex network environments.

            description: |
              Settling on PQC algorithms is only part of the journey to make our digital systems safe from the Quantum Apocalypse.  An essential step is for certificates of various types to support PQC and for the regulations to allow them. 
              
              ETSI is the governing body empowered by the European Union to give us the eIDAS standard for digital certificates.  In this session you will learn ETSI’s plans for PQC, the status PQC in the standards-making process, and expectations for when PQC-enabled eIDAS certificates will be available.

          - title: "Beyond the Quantum Threat: Demonstrating Real-World Blockchain Resilience"
            description: |
              Cryptocurrencies rely on PKI to ensure the authenticity and integrity of transactions through digital signatures. At the heart of this trust model is Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), which underpins the authenticity and integrity of every transaction within a blockchain network. PKI ensures that digital signatures—whether from payers initiating cryptocurrency transfers or validators confirming blocks—are verifiable and tamper-proof. RSA and ECC have long secured this ecosystem, but quantum computing threatens to break these algorithms via Shor’s algorithm, enabling private key recovery. An existing cryptocurrency network has been successfully transitioned to quantum-safety by using NIST finalist post-quantum algorithms, preserving performance, interoperability, and trust. This work demonstrates not only the feasibility but also the urgency of adapting PKI for a secure, post-quantum blockchain future.

            description: |
              The time to prepare for the quantum threat is upon us, and the move from traditional crypto to PQC will touch just about every cryptographic system and piece of infrastructure. To make the transition, organizations need visibility into their cryptographic estate (hardware, software, keys, certificates, secrets, etc.) and ensure they have built in crypto-agility. How does one achieve a mature crypto-agile security practice? By defining crypto-agility and understanding what it looks like for your organization. But crypto-agility is much more than moving from one system or algorithm to another. It’s about people, processes and technology. It’s about visualizing your cryptographic assets, implementing policy, driving compliance and more. In this session, we’ll discuss in detail the necessary elements to achieve a mature crypto-agile security practice, and how to overcome the challenges to get there.

          - title: Overcoming Challenges in Post-Quantum Cryptography Adoption
            description: |
              With the release of standards for Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) algorithms, the cryptographic community faces a paradigm shift. Unlike RSA, ECC, and DH, which were often regarded as "silver bullets" due to their efficiency in key size, signature size, and performance, current PQC algorithms introduce significant challenges. 
              
              This session will explore the practical obstacles of integrating PQC algorithms into existing products and services. Topics include the use of embedded systems that leverage LMS or ML-DSA signatures to verify component integrity, and the implications for services delivering image signature solutions, particularly with regard to backend HSM operations and compliance with CNSA 2.0. Finally, we examine how open-source PKI management tools, purpose-built for PQC, can help meet these challenges by providing scalable and adaptable infrastructures for orchestrating post-quantum cryptographic operations.

            description: |
              This presentation will share the lessons learned during the migration of several real-world systems to post-quantum cryptography and provide performance data. Specifically, we will cover three use cases carried out by two banks and the Dutch tax authority and zoom in on the technical and non-technical challenges that arose during those use cases. Some of the topics that will be discussed are crypto-agility in code, architectural solutions to blocking vendor dependencies and how to involve vendor management. Additionally, we will give an overview of the performance results of some of the migrated systems.

            description: |
              Hardware/firmware co-design provides a critical advantage in post-quantum cryptographic deployments by enabling agility against evolving threats. Unlike immutable hardware-only roots of trust-potentially vulnerable to future side-channel attacks and costly remediation-co-designed systems allow field updates to mitigate emerging vulnerabilities. Real-world incidents like Checkm8 highlight the risk of static hardware. In contrast, updateable firmware enables proactive responses, including SCA patching, parameter updates, and crypto migration. This talk explores how co-design enhances security lifecycle resilience, accelerates secure development, and supports crypto agility-vital for PQC in constrained, real-world environments.

            description: |
              As the industry accelerates preparations for the post-quantum era, a growing number of organizations are grappling with a practical question: Which PQC deployment strategy is right for us? Should we adopt hybrid certificates, go pure post-quantum, use composite keys, or run dual cryptographic infrastructures? Each approach offers different trade-offs in terms of risk, interoperability, compliance, and operational complexity.
      
              This panel brings together leading experts and implementers to explore real-world use cases, deployment decisions, and the rationale behind them. Panelists will share insights into how organizations are evaluating the threat landscape, aligning cryptographic agility with business needs, and choosing between strategies.
      
              This session is designed for architects, security engineers, and decision-makers who need to answer the increasingly common question: What should we do, and why?

            description: |
              As quantum computing advances, the cryptographic integrity of long-lived IoT devices is increasingly at risk. This presentation demonstrates a practical approach to securing Firmware Over-the-Air (FOTA) updates on ESP32-based IoT devices using Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC).

              We explore how NIST-standardized digital signature algorithms-ML-DSA (FIPS 204, formerly CRYSTALS-Dilithium) and SLH-DSA (FIPS 205, formerly SPHINCS+)-can be integrated into the ESP32 secure boot process to replace classical RSA/ECDSA schemes. Using the Open Quantum Safe (OQS) library, we implement PQC signing on resource-constrained hardware and evaluate the trade-offs in performance, code size, and interoperability.

              The presentation features real-world deployment on ESP32 hardware, and includes practical guidance on hybrid signing approaches (e.g., ECDSA + ML-DSA) for maintaining backward compatibility. Tools such as ESP-IDF, PlatformIO, and custom signing scripts are used throughout.

            description: |
              Quantum computing is reshaping the foundations of digital trust, and PKI must be the first to adapt. While NIST-standard algorithms like ML-KEM and ML-DSA progress toward adoption, organizations face a deeper challenge: evolving legacy PKI into a crypto-agile, automated, and future-ready infrastructure. This session presents a blueprint for enabling that transition, without starting from scratch.
      
              We’ll explore three strategic priorities:
              
              1. Assess cryptographic exposure across TLS, S/MIME, code signing, and device identity.
              2. Embed crypto-agility and automation into certificate lifecycles using hybrid certs (draft-ietf-lamps-x509-slhdsa-09), short-lived certificates, and ACME-based issuance models.
              3. Align PKI governance with emerging standards from NIST(1800-38B), ETSI, CAB Forum, and IETF.

          - title: Implementing Hybrid TLS with ML-KEM-768 for Post-Quantum Security in Mobile IIoT Deployments
            description: |
              This study integrates post-quantum cryptography into mobile IIoT via Cisco Packet Tracer models of Mobile Manufacturing Trucks and a centralized Security Operations Center. Trucks deploy sensors, routers and Quantum Shieldz AX200 modules and the SOC uses AX300DS and AXMS100DS. Hybrid TLS merges ECDHE with the ML-KEM-768 key-encapsulation mechanism (as standardized in NIST FIPS 203) . Node-RED and MQTT simulate real-time sensor streams over channels secured by SHA-3 integrity checks and QRNG keys. Tests show a 1.3× handshake-latency increase, under 300 ms responsiveness and anomaly detection under 1.5 s, meeting IEC 62443. Simulated MITM, DoS and outages yield seamless failover and state restoration. These findings confirm PQC feasibility in resource-constrained mobile IIoT and highlight the need for quantum-safe strategies. Future work will explore AI anomaly prediction, lattice signatures and hardware attestation.

            description: |
              Cryptographic inventories in modern enterprises are vast and the resulting alert fatigue often obscures true risk. This talk presents a novel method for automated, context-aware triage of cryptographic vulnerabilities. The technique leverages a large-scale, expert-curated knowledge base of cryptographic objects to enrich an organization's asset inventory.
              
              This enrichment process automates expert-level analysis to distinguish benign issues (e.g., a weak key in sample code) from critical threats (the same key in production). By intelligently filtering informational noise & presenting assets in a structured, explorable format, the method transforms data overload into actionable intelligence. We demonstrate how this context-aware triaging enables security teams to isolate root causes & shift from reactive alert management to a strategy of precise, proactive remediation. The cryptographic clarity achieved through this method will significantly accelerate an organization's migration to PQC.

            description: |
              As quantum computing advances, assessing the potential of current architectures to threaten AES encryption is essential. This study evaluates leading quantum processors, IBM, Google, Zuchongzhi 2, Microsoft, Rigetti, IonQ, and Honeywell, focusing on quantum gate complexity, qubit coherence time, and scalability trade-offs. It demonstrates how these systems, when scaled to thousands of qubits with error correction, could compromise AES security. The findings offer clearer insight into the timeline of quantum threats, aiding in strategic planning for mitigation and PQC migration. Enhancing AES robustness through longer key sizes and hybrid models is also explored to strengthen cryptographic readiness.
