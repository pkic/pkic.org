      title: NIST Post-Quantum Cryptography Update
      description: |
        In August 2024, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) reached a pivotal moment by releasing the first three finalized Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) standards: FIPS 203, FIPS 204, and FIPS 205. These standards mark the beginning of a new era in cryptography, designed to protect against the future threat of quantum computing.

        In this presentation, Dr. Dustin Moody, a leading mathematician at NIST, will provide an in-depth update on the newly established FIPS PQC standards. He will also discuss the ongoing efforts to standardize additional cryptographic algorithms, ensuring preparedness for potential vulnerabilities in the current standards.

        Mr. Bill Newhouse, a cybersecurity engineer and Project Lead at the NIST National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE), will explain the urgency of transitioning to these new quantum-resistant cryptographic standards. He will also share practical strategies and best practices to facilitate the migration from existing public-key cryptographic systems to these next-generation standards.

      description: |
        This panel will bring together industry leaders from the **Financial**, **Mobile**, **Healthcare**, and **Aviation** sectors to discuss the critical transition to post-quantum cryptography (PQC). Panelists from leading banks, the GSMA Association, DirectTrust, and other key stakeholders will explore the growing threat posed by quantum computing to traditional cryptographic systems. They will discuss the unique challenges each industry faces in adopting quantum-resistant solutions, including technical, regulatory, and operational hurdles. Key topics will include the current state of readiness, strategies for smooth transitions, the role of standards bodies, and collaborative efforts across industries. The discussion will also address timelines, cost considerations, and the importance of future-proofing critical infrastructure to ensure security in a post-quantum world.

          description: |
            At last years PQC Conference we benchmarked Hardware Securtiy Modules with Dilithium. Now that FIPS-204 is released, it is time to forget about Dilithium and do production level integrations using ML-DSA.
            This session shows PKI application integration for issuing certificates, with a number of HSMs that are ready for ML-DSA. We will highlight how easy, or hard, it is to integrate using PKCS#11 or REST APIs. Of course there will be benchmarks of certificate issuance comparing ML-DSA against classic algorithms. Let's see what else we are able to squeeze in until January.

      description: |
        NIST has finalized the first set of post-quantum algorithms, and post-quantum key agreement has been enabled by default in browsers for over a year. Why are signatures lagging behind? This talk provides the latest updates in a fast-moving ecosystem, a recap of the challenges in migrating to post-quantum certificates, and an overview of ongoing efforts to make post-quantum signatures practical in the WebPKI.

        In a followup breakout session, we go into detail into some of the more promising proposals for coping with post-quantum certificates.

          title: Making PQ signatures work in the WebPKI
          description: |
            Post-quantum signatures are not easily deployable in the WebPKI. Using the signature algorithms recently standardized by NIST as drop-in replacements for existing classical algorithms on the Web would incur significant performance degradations, making this approach infeasible unless a cryptographically-relevant quantum computer (CRQCs) is imminent. There’s a real risk that post-quantum signatures do not see widespread adoption before CRQCs become a reality, unless we make changes to how signatures are used in the WebPKI.

            This talk dives into several of the more promising proposals for making post-quantum signatures deployable, from TLS extensions to reduce the number of transmitted signatures, to using key agreement as an authentication mechanism, to complete overhauls of the WebPKI. We discuss ongoing work to evaluate the feasibility of each of these proposals and to address known unknowns.

      title: Is CBOM Enough?
      description: |
        A number of organizations are framing the migration to post-quantum cryptography (PQC) as an opportunity to affect broader IT security modernization across their organizations, especially as it relates to managing the full life cycle of cryptographic algorithms, libraries, and protocols. This presentation introduces the idea of a Cryptographic Bill of Materials (CBOM), often considered a key element of this IT modernization effort. We compare and contrast CBOM with the more familiar Software Bill of Materials (SBOM), paying particular attention to how the cryptographic ecosystem poses unique challenges compared to software-at-large. For example, many cryptographic protocols include a negotiation phase over the wire, complicating the effort to know exactly which algorithm was used in any given protocol handshake. We explore the types of cryptographic assurance that a CBOM can and cannot provide for an organization. Finally, we describe how supplementary efforts such as key management, real-time cryptographic monitoring, and the ability to execute historical queries are needed to fill in the operational gaps of a CBOM.

      title: "Communication among Financial Institutions: What are the available answers to the quantum threat?"
      description: |
        As central banks, financial institutions, and payment platforms rely heavily on secure communication for transactions, client information, and regulatory compliance, the advent of quantum computing poses a significant threat to some of the classical encryption methods underpinning these systems. Quantum computers, with their potential to solve integer factorization (used in RSA) and discrete logarithm problems (used in ECC) exponentially faster than classical computers, could break widely used cryptographic systems like RSA, Diffie-Hellman, and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), which secure most financial communications today. This quantum threat calls for proactive strategies to ensure the long-term security of financial networks. In this work, we have explored the available solutions, working closely with different encryption technologies and key management systems. The network is based on cloud VPN, providing a high level of cryptoagility, or the ability to switch between cryptographic algorithms efficiently, and shows significant interoperability among providers featuring standard protocols."
