      title: Quantum-safe PKI for the German administration
      description: |
        The BSI is in control of the root certification authority of the public administration Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). This PKI is an essential element of the German government’s business processes at federal, state and municipal levels. For instance, subscribers of this PKI receive a signed certificate corresponding to a cryptographic key pair, which is used for identification, encryption, the creation of electronic signatures and other applications.

        Currently, this PKI is based on RSA-4096. Hence, its security is threatened by the potential development of cryptographically relevant quantum computers. In order to address this threat, a full migration to a PKI based on quantum-safe cryptographic primitives has to be carried out.

        Due to the variety of use-cases within this PKI, a number of technical requirements concerning performance, security and interoperability have to be taken into account in this migration. The goal of the talk is to discuss these requirements in detail and to present several concepts and possible solutions. In particular, we argue that a parallelized migration approach is essential in order to ensure constant availability of the system. Moreover, we discuss why standardized, stateful hash-based signature schemes such as XMSS or LMS are promising candidates for the root-CA-level in the PKI hierarchy.

      description: |
        We are at a pivotal moment in cybersecurity. Browsers are preparing to (and may already have) enable(d) post-quantum encryption by default to counter the store-now-decrypt-later threat. What once was the subject of futuristic tech demos, will soon become the baseline expectation for security. Encryption is only half the story. Post-quantum certificates are much more challenging to deploy. In this talk, we will take measure of the current state, and the challenges that lay ahead for the public Web and its PKI.

      title: Post-quantum crypto integration for enterprise applications
      description: |
        Quantum computing promises to build computers capable of solving complex problems much faster than today's computers. This will benefit to many real-world applications such AI, machine learning, optimization problems, complex financial modelling etc. However, upcoming quantum computers will have a crypto-apocalyptic impact on cybersecurity, as they will allow breaking most public-key encryption algorithms in use today. Many applications rely on these encryption algorithms to ensure the security of our sensitive data. To survive in the quantum era, applications must migrate to quantum safe schemes, and preparing for this migration must already start now.
        In this talk, I will discuss our experience in integrating post-quantum crypto in enterprise applications. I’ll first describe quantum-safe TLS to secure the communication for PostgreSQL which is an open-source client-server database. Then I’ll continue with hash-based signature for digitally signing software packages with a focus on JarSigner which is an open-source for signing JAR files.

      description: |
        After TCP/IP, X.509 is probably the most widely deployed technology in modern networking. Use cases of X.509 from the incredibly mainstream to the incredibly niche are as diverse as the Internet itself. This talk will classify different types of PKI deployments according to the types of challenges that they will face during PQ transition including discoverability of the crypto in use (cryptographic bill of materials CBOM), hardware lock-in, which, depending where it is in your network, leads to different types of migration challenges, and the security properties needing during the migration. We will then survey a suite of crypto discovery and transition tools discussing which migration types and security properties they address.
