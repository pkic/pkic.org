      description: |
        The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been actively engaged in the solicitation, evaluation, and standardization of quantum-resistant public-key cryptographic algorithms. This year, in August, marked a significant milestone as NIST released a request for comments on the first three draft Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) for Post-Quantum Cryptography, following their successful completion of the initial four evaluation rounds.

        In this presentation, Mr. Bill Newhouse and Dr. Dustin Moody from NIST will provide a comprehensive update, offering insights into the status of standardization, and the development of practices to ease migration from quantum-vulnerable public-key cryptography to quantum-resistant public-key cryptography.

        Furthermore, in his Wednesday presentation, Dr. Dustin Moody will offer a more comprehensive examination of the standardization process for additional signature schemes. The first round of candidates was unveiled in July, and during his presentation, Dr. Moody will illuminate the various approaches taken and the feedback received since their initial announcement.

      description: |
        In the point of view of the Federal Office for Information Security in Germany (BSI), the question of "if" or "when" there will be quantum computers is no longer paramount. First post-quantum algorithms have been selected by NIST for standardisation and post-quantum cryptography will be used by default. Therefore, the migration to post-quantum cryptography should be pushed forward.

        In this presentation, the BSI will expound upon its post-quantum cryptography policy and roadmap. We will emphasize the significance of the migration to post-quantum algorithms in safeguarding critical digital infrastructure, data, and communications. The presentation will elucidate the BSI’s approach, outlining the trajectory of post-quantum cryptography adoption as the default cryptographic standard.

      title: A quantum cybersecurity agenda for Europe
      description: |
        The rapid development of quantum computing creates a new set of challenges for European cybersecurity. In recent years, the European Union has pursued an ambitious cybersecurity agenda but nevertheless, there are still questions about the current framework’s fitness to respond to these new challenges. Particularly worrisome is the advent of quantum attacks on encryption that risk rendering current cryptographic systems obsolete as they are in use. In July 2023, the European Policy Centre, with the support of Quantum Delta NL, published a discussion paper in which it analyses the criticality of preparing for quantum attacks on encryption by the creation of a new quantum cybersecurity agenda that improves technical and political coordination between EU member states and EU bodies and institutions for the transition to post-quantum cryptography and the future use of other quantum-safe technologies.

        The European Policy Centre (EPC) is an independent, not-for-profit think tank dedicated to fostering European integration through analysis and debate, supporting and challenging decision-makers at all levels to make informed decisions based on evidence and analysis, and providing a platform for engaging partners, stakeholders and citizens in EU policy-making and in the debate about the future of Europe.

      description: |
        We are at a pivotal moment in cybersecurity. Browsers are preparing to (and may already have) enable(d) post-quantum encryption by default to counter the store-now-decrypt-later threat. What once was the subject of futuristic tech demos, will soon become the baseline expectation for security. Encryption is only half the story. Post-quantum certificates are much more challenging to deploy. In this talk, we will take measure of the current state, and the challenges that lay ahead for the public Web and its PKI.

      title: Post-quantum crypto integration for enterprise applications
      description: |
        Quantum computing promises to build computers capable of solving complex problems much faster than today's computers. This will benefit to many real-world applications such AI, machine learning, optimization problems, complex financial modelling etc. However, upcoming quantum computers will have a crypto-apocalyptic impact on cybersecurity, as they will allow breaking most public-key encryption algorithms in use today. Many applications rely on these encryption algorithms to ensure the security of our sensitive data. To survive in the quantum era, applications must migrate to quantum safe schemes, and preparing for this migration must already start now.
        In this talk, I will discuss our experience in integrating post-quantum crypto in enterprise applications. I’ll first describe quantum-safe TLS to secure the communication for PostgreSQL which is an open-source client-server database. Then I’ll continue with hash-based signature for digitally signing software packages with a focus on JarSigner which is an open-source for signing JAR files.

      description: |
        After TCP/IP, X.509 is probably the most widely deployed technology in modern networking. Use cases of X.509 from the incredibly mainstream to the incredibly niche are as diverse as the Internet itself. This talk will classify different types of PKI deployments according to the types of challenges that they will face during PQ transition including discoverability of the crypto in use (cryptographic bill of materials CBOM), hardware lock-in, which, depending where it is in your network, leads to different types of migration challenges, and the security properties needing during the migration. We will then survey a suite of crypto discovery and transition tools discussing which migration types and security properties they address.

        In this presentation, Dr. Dustin Moody, a distinguished expert from the U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), will take you on a deep dive into NIST's standardization efforts for additional signature schemes.

        With the first round of additional signature scheme candidates announced in July, Dr. Moody will shed light on various approaches, including Code-based, Isogeny, Lattice-based, Multivariate, and others. He will also share insights into the feedback received since their initial announcement.

        This session promises to provide valuable insights, expert analysis, and a comprehensive understanding of NIST's ongoing mission to strengthen our digital future against the quantum threat.

      title: Quantum-safe PKI for the German administration
      description: |
        The BSI is in control of the root certification authority of the public administration Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). This PKI is an essential element of the German government’s business processes at federal, state and municipal levels. For instance, subscribers of this PKI receive a signed certificate corresponding to a cryptographic key pair, which is used for identification, encryption, the creation of electronic signatures and other applications.

        Currently, this PKI is based on RSA-4096. Hence, its security is threatened by the potential development of cryptographically relevant quantum computers. In order to address this threat, a full migration to a PKI based on quantum-safe cryptographic primitives has to be carried out.

        Due to the variety of use-cases within this PKI, a number of technical requirements concerning performance, security and interoperability have to be taken into account in this migration. The goal of the talk is to discuss these requirements in detail and to present several concepts and possible solutions. In particular, we argue that a parallelized migration approach is essential in order to ensure constant availability of the system. Moreover, we discuss why standardized, stateful hash-based signature schemes such as XMSS or LMS are promising candidates for the root-CA-level in the PKI hierarchy.

          title: A testbed for evaluating post-quantum algorithms in DNS
          description: |
            DNS is an fundamental Internet service that translates human-readable names to IP addresses. It is secured using DNSSEC, an extension that provides authentication and integrity through the use of cryptographic signatures. The inherent limitations of the DNS protocol lead to requirements for the signing algoritms, specifically in terms of key size and signature size. This leads to challenges when deploying post-quantum algoritms. SIDN Labs is setting up a testbed in which developers, network researchers, and DNS operators can experiment with PQC algorithms and DNSSEC. Ultimately, the goal is to evaluate existing post-quantum cryptographic algorithms developers for use in DNS. In this presentation, we discuss some challenges and our progress on setting up a PQC-testbed for DNS.
