      description: |
        The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been actively engaged in the solicitation, evaluation, and standardization of quantum-resistant public-key cryptographic algorithms. This year, in August, marked a significant milestone as NIST released a request for comments on the first three draft Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) for Post-Quantum Cryptography, following their successful completion of the initial four evaluation rounds.

        In this presentation, Mr. Bill Newhouse and Dr. Dustin Moody from NIST will provide a comprehensive update, offering insights into the status of standardization, and the development of practices to ease migration from quantum-vulnerable public-key cryptography to quantum-resistant public-key cryptography.

        Furthermore, in his Wednesday presentation, Dr. Dustin Moody will offer a more comprehensive examination of the standardization process for additional signature schemes. The first round of candidates was unveiled in July, and during his presentation, Dr. Moody will illuminate the various approaches taken and the feedback received since their initial announcement.

      title: A quantum cybersecurity agenda for Europe
      description: |
        The rapid development of quantum computing creates a new set of challenges for European cybersecurity. In recent years, the European Union has pursued an ambitious cybersecurity agenda but nevertheless, there are still questions about the current framework’s fitness to respond to these new challenges. Particularly worrisome is the advent of quantum attacks on encryption that risk rendering current cryptographic systems obsolete as they are in use. In July 2023, the European Policy Centre, with the support of Quantum Delta NL, published a discussion paper in which it analyses the criticality of preparing for quantum attacks on encryption by the creation of a new quantum cybersecurity agenda that improves technical and political coordination between EU member states and EU bodies and institutions for the transition to post-quantum cryptography and the future use of other quantum-safe technologies.

        The European Policy Centre (EPC) is an independent, not-for-profit think tank dedicated to fostering European integration through analysis and debate, supporting and challenging decision-makers at all levels to make informed decisions based on evidence and analysis, and providing a platform for engaging partners, stakeholders and citizens in EU policy-making and in the debate about the future of Europe.

First post-quantum algorithms have been selected by NIST for standardisation and post-quantum cryptography will be used by default. Therefore, the migration to post-quantum cryptography should be pushed forward.

        In this presentation, the BSI will expound upon its post-quantum cryptography policy and roadmap. We will emphasize the significance of the migration to post-quantum algorithms in safeguarding critical digital infrastructure, data, and communications. The presentation will elucidate the BSI’s approach, outlining the trajectory of post-quantum cryptography adoption as the default cryptographic standard.

        In this presentation, we will delve into the Dutch central governments’ approach to mitigate the risks of quantum technology. Quantum resilient Cryptography  governance and regulation can help in mitigating these risks. Positioned at the forefront of quantum-resilient cryptography, a resource was crafted that extends beyond theoretical discussions, offering organizations concrete steps and invaluable advice. Because of our approach this will not only reach the government, but also IT-providers, and (vital) sectors in the Netherlands.

        The commitment to fortifying global cybersecurity is exemplified by the Dutch [PQC Migration Handbook](https://english.aivd.nl/publications/publications/2023/04/04/the-pqc-migration-handbook). This indispensable resource equips organizations with pragmatic guidance on how to proactively mitigate the imminent threat posed by quantum computers to today’s cryptographic systems.

      description: |
        The whole industry is working on standardizing and implementing post-quantum cryptography, in order to mitigate the risk from future quantum computers. One question that is (and will probably remain) unanswered is “when are quantum computers going to be powerful enough to break cryptography?”. At the same time, there are regular press releases about new methods of breaking cryptography in the short term. These publications often cause panic and confusion which is counter-productive to the process of mitigating the quantum risk.
        
        In this presentation we give a high-level description on how quantum algorithms work, and what still needs to happen before such algorithms can be implemented on real hardware. A simple model can be used to make sense of past and future announcements on the nearing moment of the cryptopocalypse (the point at which quantum computing becomes powerful enough to use Shor's algorithm to crack public-key cryptography). We discuss some of the examples from the past year.

          title: "LMS: Lighter, faster key generation"
          description: |
            The Leighton-Micali Signature (LMS) system is a stateful hash-based signature scheme whose security relies on properties of hash functions, standing at a comfortable security level against attackers in possession of quantum computers. As such, LMS has been standardized by NIST in SP-800-208 and is regarded as a suitable post-quantum signature algorithm in industry.

            At its core, generating an LMS private key and obtaining its corresponding public key involves computing an exponential number of hashes and eventually representing large Merkle trees in memory. Moreover, signing with this key later requires recovering subsets of the hashes computed at key generation time. Sequential, high memory approaches to these operations achieve best signature speed, but make LMS key generation prohibitively slow and resource-intensive. While there are a number of hardware-oriented efforts to optimize LMS, some open-source software implementations do not take advantage of known memory trade-offs and opt for small parameter sets.

            In this talk, we describe how to make LMS key generation procedure faster with SIMD hashing (by adapting the low-memory iterative algorithm of RFC8554) and recall algorithms that trade off signature speed against succinct representations of private keys in memory.

          description: |
            Post-quantum cryptography brought a lot of new aspects into cryptography. This includes but is not limited to the facts that schemes are build on new mathematical structures (or rather not widely used in cryptography thus far), security proofs rely on new techniques as well as a deep understanding of said new structures, and implementations have to include and protect new algorithms. In addition, mathematical proofs of security get generally more complex and implementations have to protect against more and more attack vectors. This makes the whole development prone to error. An approach to deal with the added complexity and add reliable security guarantees is the use of computers to machine-check security proofs and implementations. In this talk I will discuss the challenges, and present ongoing projects aiming at machine-checking security proofs and implementations of PQC in EasyCrypt, and Jasmine within the Formosa Crypto consortium.

            The GSMA Post Quantum Telco Network Task Force has been dedicated to exploring the implications of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) within the telecommunications space. Our mission extends beyond theoretical discussions, focusing on the tangible impacts on Network Operators and the broader telco supply chain.

            The task force is a collaborative effort involving more than 50 companies representing operators, government and the wider Telco supply chain, including over 20 major network operators globally.

            Earlier this year, we published a comprehensive [Post Quantum Telco Network Impact Assessment Whitepaper](https://www.gsma.com/newsroom/wp-content/uploads//PQ.1-Post-Quantum-Telco-Network-Impact-Assessment-Whitepaper-Version1.0.pdf). Building on this groundwork, we are now actively developing Quantum Risk Management guidelines tailored specifically to the telecommunications industry. Additionally, we are crafting best practice guidelines that delve into Telco use cases, with a particular emphasis on Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) implications.

      title: Post-quantum crypto integration for enterprise applications
      description: |
        Quantum computing promises to build computers capable of solving complex problems much faster than today’s computers. This will benefit to many real-world applications such AI, machine learning, optimization problems, complex financial modelling etc. However, upcoming quantum computers will have a crypto-apocalyptic impact on cybersecurity, as they will allow breaking most public-key encryption algorithms in use today. Many applications rely on these encryption algorithms to ensure the security of our sensitive data. To survive in the quantum era, applications must migrate to quantum safe schemes, and preparing for this migration must already start now. In this talk, I will present our work, which was supported by the German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK) in the project Trade-EVs II (FKZ: 01MV20006A), and discuss our experience in integrating post-quantum crypto in enterprise applications. I’ll first describe quantum-safe TLS to secure the communication for PostgreSQL which is an open-source client-server database. Then I’ll continue with hash-based signature for digitally signing software packages with a focus on JarSigner which is an open-source for signing JAR files.

          description: |
            DNS is an fundamental Internet service that translates human-readable names to IP addresses. It is secured using DNSSEC, an extension that provides authentication and integrity through the use of cryptographic signatures. The inherent limitations of the DNS protocol lead to requirements for the signing algoritms, specifically in terms of key size and signature size. This leads to challenges when deploying post-quantum algoritms. SIDN Labs is setting up a testbed in which developers, network researchers, and DNS operators can experiment with PQC algorithms and DNSSEC. Ultimately, the goal is to evaluate existing post-quantum cryptographic algorithms developers for use in DNS. In this presentation, we discuss some challenges and our progress on setting up a PQC-testbed for DNS.

      description: |
        In the fast-approaching post-quantum era, mobile ecosystems, including smartphones, grapple with the formidable task of integrating advanced cryptographic methods. The main challenge lies in the resource-intensive nature of post-quantum cryptography, requiring increased computational power and hardware acceleration. This urgency is driven by the rising threat of quantum computing, making a swift transition to post-quantum cryptography imperative for robust data protection. During the presentation, we will delve into a case study of implementing SPHINCS within the mobile ecosystem, demonstrating that leveraging existing hardware resources is a viable approach but we still need improvements in hardware.

      title: How to Sell Post-Quantum Readiness by Combining it with a Zero Trust Journey
      description: |
        Convincing the board of the urgency and importance of PQC can be challenging, especially when there are competing priorities and limited resources.

        One possible way to sell PQC to the board is by combining it with a zero trust journey, which is a holistic approach to cybersecurity that assumes no trust in any entity, whether internal or external, and verifies every request and transaction. A zero trust journey can help organizations achieve better security outcomes, such as reducing the attack surface, enhancing visibility and control, and improving compliance and resilience. By aligning PQC with a zero trust journey, organizations can demonstrate how PQC can support and enable their strategic goals, such as digital transformation, innovation, and customer satisfaction.

        In this presentation, we will discuss how to leverage the benefits of a zero trust journey to make a compelling case for PQC. We will also share some best practices and tips on how to plan and execute a successful PQC transition that is aligned with a zero trust journey.

      title: Quantum-safe PKI for the German administration
      description: |
        The BSI is in control of the root certification authority of the public administration Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). This PKI is an essential element of the German government’s business processes at federal, state and municipal levels. For instance, subscribers of this PKI receive a signed certificate corresponding to a cryptographic key pair, which is used for identification, encryption, the creation of electronic signatures and other applications.

        Currently, this PKI is based on RSA-4096. Hence, its security is threatened by the potential development of cryptographically relevant quantum computers. In order to address this threat, a full migration to a PKI based on quantum-safe cryptographic primitives has to be carried out.

        Due to the variety of use-cases within this PKI, a number of technical requirements concerning performance, security and interoperability have to be taken into account in this migration. The goal of the talk is to discuss these requirements in detail and to present several concepts and possible solutions. In particular, we argue that a parallelized migration approach is essential in order to ensure constant availability of the system. Moreover, we discuss why standardized, stateful hash-based signature schemes such as XMSS or LMS are promising candidates for the root-CA-level in the PKI hierarchy.

            Symmetric encryption algorithms, such as AES256, are already considered to be post-quantum secure, meaning that they are resistant to attack by quantum computers. This fact is often overlooked in discussions about post-quantum cryptography, but it is important to remember that symmetric encryption can be used to protect data even if quantum computers become powerful enough to break asymmetric encryption algorithms. In this presentation we will explore how symmetric encryption algorithms can be used to protect existing asymmetric implementations.

          description: |  
            Symmetric cryptographic primitives such as AES are simple, efficient and secure – even in a post-quantum world – which makes them interesting for a variation of purposes where we need secure encryption, but with strong constraints to computing power and storage. Traditionally a downside of these algorithms has been their static, long-term keys, making it hard to achieve security properties such as forward secrecy without negotiating a new key every time.

            In this talk we will look at a number of protocols that achieve symmetric authenticated key exchange: we propose new methods of key evolution that guarantee full forward secrecy, while also taking care of key synchronization between the involved parties. This makes them very suitable for IoT devices, or other settings where efficient post-quantum cryptography is required.

          description: |
            Blockchain technology was created to make the storage of data or transactions more secure.  It has revolutionized the way we process transactions with improved security, efficiency, and transparency.  PKI is the security backbone of blockchain technology to ensure the integrity and trustworthiness of a blockchain network.  In the world of cryptocurrencies, private keys are used by the payer to sign and initiate a transaction.  It is also used by a validator to sign and assure the world that a transaction has been validated.  RSA and ECC are the most commonly used algorithms in the current PKI ecosystem.  It has been proven for over 40 years that the private key cannot be reverse engineered back from its public key even using the most powerful super computer today.  However, the rapid development of quantum computing is posing security threats to PKI because its excessive power can derive the private key back from its public key.  This breaks the backbone of blockchain security because transactions cannot be trusted anymore.  In this session we will cover quantum threats to blockchain.  We will also demonstrate some practical implementations of PQC that have been performed to convert an existing blockchain network to become quantum-safe.

      title: Moving toward a Quantum Security Maturity Index
      description: | 
        Recent advances in quantum computing, factoring algorithms, and hybrid compute approaches toward development of cryptographically relevant quantum computers have made the need to proactively defend our enterprises from this threat an immediate requirement.  

        Today there are a variety of approaches toward mitigating this risk that are being considered, developed, and deployed around the world.  There are leading sectors and trailing sectors in terms of adoption, and there are different algorithms and architectures being relied on in various parts of the world.  The constant message from government and industry is to 'Start Now' and while that is good, we need to consider what's next.

        With the variety of approaches and levels of maturity, there is a global move to agree upon a common maturity index that would support a common vocabulary, improve quantum defenses, consistently measure progress, share knowledge, and prioritize actions and budgets.

        These maturity index levels would cover initial risk and strategy, discovery and inventory, crypto ecosystem, architectures, testing, trials, roll outs, and a steady state managed operation. Included in each of these levels would be reference to approaches such as CBOMs, crypto agility, quantum key distribution, algorithm selection, and more.

        This talk will provide an introduction to the maturity index concept for quantum, an update on what else is happening around the world, and provide an invitation to participate in both the definitions, adoptions, and benefits of a globally accepted post quantum maturity index.

Next to TLS many other digital services rely on PKIs for their security; one important example is the electronic signatures on documents, which are standardized in PAdES and have legal value in many countries. One of the services which provides PAdES support is the european Digital Signing Service (DSS). To support the transition to quantum-safe PKIs we have created an extension for DSS, which allows users to use a hybrid certificate to sign and validate a PDF-document. In this presentation we will show our work and explain some of the decisions that we made in the process.
