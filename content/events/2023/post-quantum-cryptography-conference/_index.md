      title: Status report on Post-Quantum Cryptography Standardization
      description: |
          There is a significant probability that, in the coming decades, a large quantum computer can be built. When this happens, much of the cryptography that currently secures communications will have to be replaced by new, quantum resistant, cryptographic standards. For the last several years, NIST has been embarked on a process of selecting new, quantum-resistant, algorithms for  public-key cryptography. These algorithms will be the basis for the new  standards. I will describe the quantum computer threat and the measures we are taking to address it. Then I will report on the current status of our standardization effort.

      title: PQC at the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)
      description: |
        Just as post quantum is providing challenges for a generation of academic cryptographers, so too is it providing challenges for cryptographic engineers. The new PQC primitives behave differently enough from their RSA and ECC predecessors that they sometimes require substantial protocol and application re-design in order to accommodate them. On top of that we need to engineer for gracefully migrating all of the Internet's systems in a fairly abrupt timeline. This talk will overview IETF progress at integrating PQC into common Internet protocols: challenges, progress, and work yet-to-be-started. I will conclude with my personal research area: PKI PQ/Traditional hybrid modes that enhance both security and migration flexibility.

      title: Mixed Certificate Chains for the Transition to Post-Quantum Authentication in PKI
      description: |
        In this talk, I will propose and investigate a migration strategy towards post-quantum PKI authentication. Our strategy is based on the concept of "mixed certificate chains" that use different signature algorithms within the same certificate chain. In order to demonstrate the feasibility of our migration strategy, we combine the well-studied and trusted hash-based signature schemes SPHINCS+ and XMSS with elliptic curve cryptography first and subsequently with lattice-based PQC signature schemes (Dilithium and Falcon)
