description: Iâ€™m a 1st year PhD student at the University of Siegen actively working in the field of quantum cryptography under the supervision of Dr. Ramona Wolf. The main part of my PhD concentrates on writing security proofs for QKD protocols and also incorporating resources from quantum foundations (quantum correlations) for a more practical application of QKD scheme in a lab setting.
