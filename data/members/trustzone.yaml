      Jacob is the CEO and one of the founders of TRUSTZONE, he represents the organization at the PKI Consortium. He has been in the PKI space since 2002, where he started he’s career with EuroTrust PKI Services A/S, which was later acquired by VeriSign. In 2004 Jacob founded TRUSTZONE A/S with his business partner Henrik Dürr – the duo has been running TRUSTZONE A/S successfully ever since and are still in charge of the company. 
      Jacob’s focus has primarily been the commercial angle and in that bridging the gap between complex technology and customer demands; a generalist in the specialized world of PKI, who strongly believes that even though PKI is an old term, the best is yet to come and thus making its final breakthrough in the IT security industry.
