        Passionate about cryptography and digital identity, I specialize in post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and EUDI-ARF. My work spans PQC transitions, digital signatures (PaDES/CaDES), and identity frameworks like EUDI-ARF and W3C-VC, currently focusing on EUDIW compliance/interoperability and components for crypto-agility and hybrid cryptography. Member of multiple standardization and alliances (W3C, ISO, IEEE, PKIC, RenAissence), published multiple papers on cryptography and keynote speaker on cryptography and digital identity.
