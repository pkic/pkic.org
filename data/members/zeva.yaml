      Serving as a pillar in the cryptography community for more than two decades, Andoni demonstrates a commitment to excellence in her field. Combining her customer driven leadership and technology prowess, Andoni builds and leads product teams that create revolutionary new products intent on making effective encryption and decryption capabilities more accessible to highly regulated government agencies, commercial organizations, and NGOs.

Prior to becoming the CEO of Zeva Inc., Andoni made a name for herself in the data analytics realm, most recently as the Research Director for the Center for Responsible Politics, a data-centric, non-profit organization located in Washington D.C.

Andoni holds a Bachelor’s degree in Mathematics from Bethlehem University, and a Master’s degree in Information Systems from American University in Washington D.C. When she’s not leading the development of powerful new cryptography tools, Andoni is a dedicated member of the International Women’s Forum of Washington, DC, and serves as a Co-Founder of NAAWA, the National Arab American Women’s Association. In her time off, Andoni enjoys spending time with her husband and three children while participating in fundraising for humanitarian causes and other events in the community.
