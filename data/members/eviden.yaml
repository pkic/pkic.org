      Coming from an Information Technology engineering background, with 25 years' of experience in information security, Vasco helped many customers balance operational constraints versus acceptable business risks. In the recent years he expanded this experience to help customers look into what the information security landscape might be in the next 5 years+ and best way to manage it. During innovation workshops, he shares with them some keys to anticipate the future shape of cybersecurity and maximize sovereignty over their most critical data.

      Using those customer interactions and by continuously monitoring major technological trends, he influences Eviden cybersecurity services and products roadmaps, as well as partnerships, mergers and acquisitions.
