    description: As the Founder and CEO of acubed.it, Amit leads a dynamic team of software developers and architects who are passionate about crafting innovative and secure cross-security domain solutions for the UK government and our valued clients.

      With over two decades of experience in software development, Amit brings a broad range of expertise in various technologies and methodologies. His career has been marked by significant contributions to large-scale digital transformation initiatives in both public and private sectors.

      The journey that led Amit to establish acubed.it was driven by a clear vision. Amit recognised the vital need to enhance and optimise government processes. Through unwavering dedication and a profound focus on security, his mission is to make a meaningful impact in the technology and security landscape.

      One of Amit and his team's proudest achievements is the development of the Cross Domain Hybrid Application (CDHA) Framework, a revolutionary solution that empowers government agencies to seamlessly span security boundaries while maintaining the highest levels of security and usability. CDHA is a game-changer, and we're excited to bring it to organisations that are committed to innovation and security.
