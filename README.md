## Make and preview changes
You can make simple changes in the GitHub editor. For more advanced changes you might want to run a local copy of the website.

Some basic git knowledge is required, please check https://guides.github.com/ to get started from scratch. An editor such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) can help you to [simplify most of these tasks](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github) and help you with editing the content.

1. [Install hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/#quick-install)
2. [Create a fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#fork) of this repository
3. [Clone your fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#clone)
2. Run `hugo server -D` in the root directory of your fork
3. Open the shown URL `http://localhost:xxxx/` in your browser to preview your local version
4. Make changes until you are satisfied; the preview will update automatically
5. [Commit and push your changes](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-changes)
6. [Create a pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/#making-a-pull-request)

## Adding a new member
1. Create a `new-member-name.yaml` in the `data/members` folder.
2. Create a `new-member-name.md` in the `content/members` folder.
3. Add the logo in SVG format in the folder `assets/images/members`, the filename must correspondent with id of the member (e.g., `member.svg`)

## Adding a new author
- For member authors, add a representative in the `data/members/member.yaml` file.
- For authors that are not associated with a member, add a listing in `data/authors.yaml`.

## Formatting content
The content lives in `content/` and is written as markdown because of it's simple content format. We do not allow the usage of HTML, this to enforce uniform and structured content, but there are times when Markdown falls short. For some of these reusable cases you can use built-in [shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/) or use/create a custom [shortcode](https://gohugo.io/templates/shortcode-templates/).

## Update content from other repositories

Some content is managed in external repositories through git submodules, to update the remote branch in your local preview run the following command.

```bash
git submodule update --remote
```
